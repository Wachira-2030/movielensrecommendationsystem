On evaluation, our datasets meets all of the following requirements for preprocessing to take place smoothly.

1.Completeness-There are no missing values.

2.Consistency-as the individual features meet the required set of datatypes.

3.Validity-All the columns are independent and there is unique representations of the data points.

4.Accuracy-Based on the individual features representation,despite splitting the the genre column later on,the data is all accurate
